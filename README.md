# Features

📝 It is a clean single-page layout with the necessary information to get to know me, and contact me.

🔃 Contains a Navbar with easy access on the top right, which uses the Observer API to know what section you're currently at.

⚡ It's blazing fast due to it being statically generated, with a 100% Lighthouse score.

# Instalation and setup

It's as simple as cloning this repository, `cd` into it, and executing `yarn` in order to install the dependencies.

The default command for starting the dev server is going to be `yarn dev`.

After that it's just time to edit and test!
